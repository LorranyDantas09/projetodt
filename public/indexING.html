        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Vanilson Silva, I am a businessman in the Barber Shop
          industry, since 2018. From a very young age, I worked to achieve my
          goals and dreams, I always had an entrepreneurial side, and it was in
          2016 that a friend introduced me to a hairdressing course, where I
          found myself, discovered a passion that I didn't even know could
          exist. In 2018 I opened my barber shop in the city of Ocidental, all
          with a lot of work and dedication. Every detail thought out for
          quality service. After 6 months of work, we were recognized and won
          the award for best barber shop in the surrounding area by the company
          Top Marketing, competing with Jardim Ingá and Ocidental, then in 2022
          we won the award for best barber shop in the city of Ocidental, and
          today, after 6 years, my company is structured, generating jobs and
          providing joy and self-esteem to our clients. I owe all this to myself
          for my persistence and determination to pursue my dream. There is
          still a long way to go. And I am grateful for every phase I have gone
          through and that I will still go through. Nice to meet you, I am
          Vanilson Silva, owner and proprietor of Detroit Barber Shop.
